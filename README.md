## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles


### Continued development

Both React Next.js and Astro provide a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that facilitate web application development. By exploring options like Zustand, React Query, and Framer Motion, you can enhance state management, data fetching, and animations in your projects. Additionally, styling libraries such as styled-components allow you to customize the appearance of your user interfaces.

### Useful resources

 [Create Modal](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-modal-dialogs-ui-using-react-and-tailwind-css/) - This tutorial provided a clear and concise approach to creating modals using React and Tailwind CSS. I particularly liked the use of state management to control the modal's visibility and the implementation of animations for a smooth user experience. I will definitely be incorporating these patterns into my future projects.
